# MagnetoHatesBees

Final Project placed 4th out of ~15 in MIT's first VR class competition. Built for the Google Daydream. 

You, Magneto, were out on a picnic when you were suddenly shrunk down to the size of an apple! Now a swarm of mutant bees has come and wants to steal your food. Use your power to fend off the bees and their metal stingers so you can enjoy your picnic!

This project was made over the course of 2 weeks in a hackathon-esque fashion. Please excuse any sloppy code.
